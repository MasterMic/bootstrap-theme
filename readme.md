# Bootstrap Theme
Bootstrap Theme is a simple [GetSimple CMS](http://get-simple.info/) theme based on [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/).

It aims to be *easily extended* and *extremely minimalistic*.

## Installation
Copy the `Bootstrap-Theme` folder into your `/path/to/getsimple/theme/` folder. If you need more help, follow the [general instructions](http://get-simple.info/wiki/themes:installation) provided by GetSimple.

## Example
My personal site currently uses this theme. [Check it out](http://www.ugrad.cs.ubc.ca/~k5r8/).
